given request then
    send request called check:
        method: "TRACE"
        headers:
            "Custom-Test-Header": "testvalue"

    if {check.response.headers} matches "Custom-Test-Header" then
        report issue and continue:
            severity: medium
            confidence: firm
            detail: "Server supports TRACE method and reflects request headers. This behavior can be leveraged for HTTP desync attacks."
            remediation: "Disable the TRACE method on the server or ensure that it does not reflect request headers to mitigate potential HTTP desync vulnerabilities."
